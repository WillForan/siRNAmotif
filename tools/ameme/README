CONCLUSION: improbizer does not find significant motifs in data

runMotif.sh is the primary tool (wrapper)
  iteration information is prefixed with an =
  the rest of the output has the form
    3.7838  TTATAAA 37.25   3.7838  299
    score   motif   pos     st      sequences used
    
-- never looked at the "motifOutput" option

===LISTINGS
parseAMEME_aboveAvg.pl		-- parse ameme and print new fasta files based on score
parseAMEME_topThird.pl		-- parse ameme and print new fasta files based on rank
recurse_motif.sh		-- run ameme for each new fasta file created by the perl parser (default 4 iterations)
runMotif.sh			-- Pull all of it together and run on options in a for loop: background={m0..2}; numMotifs={1..3}

results/tabDelimOutput.sh	-- parse results to table
				    e.g. 
				./tabDelimOutput.sh results-2011-05-19-12-48.txt |sort  -nr | head -n 10
===DIRECTORIES
outputs			-- output of perl parser (stores a bunch of fasta files)
results			-- store result text files produced by runMotif

===in general this is what we want to run
ameme good=../fas/300_top.fasta bad=../fas/randomIntergenic-2011-05-12-14\:24.fa > output

=== ameme was compiled from kent source and put into bin/x86_64. it was nessary to set MACHTYPE=`uname -p` to compile
